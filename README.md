## Data source

- [Kaggle Cyber Security Attacks](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/teamincribo/cyber-security-attacks/data)
  - The dataset includes data elements pertaining to cyber narratives from January 1, 2020, to October 11, 2023
  - Overview: It comprises 40,000 records, each containing 25 distinct metrics.
  - Columns or Feature Vectors:
    - Timestamp: Records the time when the network activity occurred.
    - Source IP Address: The IP address of the sender or initiator of the network traffic.
    - Destination IP Address: The IP address of the receiver or target of the network traffic.
    - Source Port: The port number used by the source IP address for communication.
    - Destination Port: The port number used by the destination IP address for communication.
    - Protocol: Specifies the communication protocol used (e.g., TCP, UDP, ICMP).
    - Packet Length: The size of the data packet, measured in bytes.
    - Packet Type: Identifies the type of packet (e.g., data packet, control packet).
    - Traffic Type: Categorizes the type of network traffic (e.g., web traffic, email traffic).
    - Payload Data: Contains the actual data transmitted within the packet.
    - Malware Indicators: Highlights potential signs of malicious activity or malware presence.
    - Anomaly Scores: Quantitative measures of deviations from expected network behavior, aiding anomaly detection.
    - Alerts/Warnings: Notifications or warnings generated by security systems or monitoring tools.
    - Attack Type: Specifies the type of detected or suspected attack (e.g., DDoS, Intrusion, Malware).
    - Attack Signature: Describes patterns or signatures associated with known attack types.
    - Action Taken: Details the response actions performed to address detected threats or anomalies.
    - Severity Level: Indicates the seriousness of an alert or event (e.g., low, medium, high).
    - User Information: Provides details about the user involved in the network activity.
    - Device Information: Contains information about the device involved (e.g., device type, operating system).
    - Network Segment: Specifies the network segment or subnet where the activity was observed.
    - Geo-location Data: Provides geographical location details linked to the IP addresses.
    - Proxy Information: Captures data about proxy servers used during network communication.
    - Firewall Logs: Logs from firewall systems indicating allowed or blocked network traffic.
    - IDS/IPS Alerts: Alerts from Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) or Intrusion Prevention Systems (IPS) for suspicious or malicious activity.
    - Log Source: Identifies the source or origin of the log entry (e.g., logging system or device name).
